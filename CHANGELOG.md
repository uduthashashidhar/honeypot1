## 20200630
- **Release T-Pot 20.06**
  - After 4 months of public testing with the NextGen edition T-Pot 20.06 can finally be released.
- **Debian Buster**
  - With the release of Debian Buster T-Pot now has access to all packages required right out of the box.
- **Add new honeypots**
  - [Dicompot](https://github.com/nsmfoo/dicompot) by @nsmfoo is a low interaction honeypot for the Dicom protocol which is the international standard to process medical imaging information. Together with Medpot which supports the HL7 protocol T-Pot is now offering a Medical Installation type.
  - [Honeysap](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/HoneySAP) by SecureAuthCorp is a low interaction honeypot for the SAP services, in case of T-Pot configured for the SAP router.
  - [Elasticpot](https://gitlab.com/bontchev/elasticpot) by Vesselin Bontchev replaces ElasticpotPY as a low interaction honeypot for Elasticsearch with more features, plugins and scripted responses.
- **Rebuild Images**
  - All docker images were rebuilt based on the latest (and stable running) versions of the tools and honeypots. Mostly the images now run on Alpine 3.12 / Debian Buster. However some honeypots / tools still reuire Alpine 3.11 / 3.10 to run properly.
- **Install Types**
  - All docker-compose files (`/opt/tpot/etc/compose`) were remixed and most of the NextGen honeypots are now available in Standard.
  - There is now a **Medical** Installation Type with Dicompot and Medpot which will be of most interest for medical institutions to get started with T-Pot.
- **Update Tools**
  - Connecting to T-Pot via `https://<ip>:64297` brings you to the T-Pot Landing Page now which is based on Heimdall and the latest NGINX enforcing TLS 1.3.
  - The ELK stack was updated to 7.8.0 and stripped down to the necessary core functions (where possible) for T-Pot while keeping ELK RAM requirements to a minimum (8GB of RAM is recommended now). The number of index pattern fields was reduced to **697** which increases performance significantly. There are **22** Kibana Dashboards, **397** Kibana Visualizations and **24** Kibana Searches readily available to cover all your needs to get started and familiar with T-Pot.
  - Cyberchef was updated to 9.21.0.
  - Elasticsearch Head was updated to the latest version available on GitHub.
  - Spiderfoot was updated to latest 3.1 dev.
- **Landing Page**
  - After logging into T-Pot via web you are now greeted with a beautifully designed landing page.
- **Countless Tweaks and improvements**
  - Under the hood lots of tiny tweaks, improvements and a few bugfixes will increase your overall experience with T-Pot.

## 20200316

## 20190502
- **Fix KVPs**

## 20190428
- **Rebuild ISO**

  - After some reports in the issues that some Debian mirrors were not fully synced and thus some packages were unavailable the netselect-apt feature was disabled.

- **Fix for SSH**
  - In some situations the SSH Port was not written to a new line (thanks to @dpisano for reporting).
- **Fix race condition for apt-fast**

## 20190404
- **Fix #332**
  - If T-Pot, opposed to the requirements, does not have full internet access netselect-apt fails to determine the fastest mirror as it needs ICMP and UDP outgoing. Should netselect-apt fail the default mirrors will be used.
- **Improve install speed with apt-fast**
  - Migrating from a stable base install to Debian (Sid) requires downloading lots of packages. Depending on your geo location the download speed was already improved by introducing netselect-apt to determine the fastest mirror. With apt-fast the downloads will be even faster by downloading packages not only in parallel but also with multiple connections per package.
